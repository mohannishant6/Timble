# Timble
A Blind Dating App

Tired of dating apps relying on superficial looks?
We present Timble- A blind Dating App, that helps you find someone based completely on their personality rather than looks.
Personality of any individal can be quantified on 5 major measures- Openness, Extraversion, Neuroticism, Conscientiousness and Agreeableness.
Not just a match, we also suggest you an outdoor fun activity for the blind-date rather than the usual awkward dates.

I worked on building User Model for each user. The user model is built using a set of fun quiz. The questions are mapped to one of the 5 personality measures.

See the demo and code for user model in this repo.

Happy Blind-dating!
